Welcome to Auto-Surprise's documentation!
=========================================

Auto-Surprise is an easy-to-use python AutoRecommenderSystem (AutoRecSys) library. It automates algorithm selection and hyperparameter tuning to build an optimized recommendation model.
It uses the popular scikit library `Surprise <http://surpriselib.com/>`_ for recommender algorithms and `Hyperopt <https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt>`_ for hyperparameter tuning.

Unfortunately, currently only linux systems are supported, but you can use WSL in windows as well.

To get started with Auto-Surprise, check out the :ref:`quick_start` guide. If you have any issues or doubts, head over to the `Github repository <https://github.com/BeelGroup/Auto-Surprise>`_
